      "question": "What is the primary purpose of machine learning?",
      "options": [
        "To manually program all behaviors",
        "To enable computers to learn from data",
        "To improve hardware efficiency",
        "To replace all human decision-making"
      ],
      "answer": "To enable computers to learn from data",
      "explanation": "Machine learning focuses on developing algorithms that allow computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed."

      "question": "Which of the following is an example of supervised learning?",
      "options": [
        "K-Means Clustering",
        "Neural Networks trained with labeled data",
        "Unsupervised Anomaly Detection",
        "Principal Component Analysis (PCA)"
      ],
      "answer": "Neural Networks trained with labeled data",
      "explanation": "Supervised learning requires labeled data, where input-output pairs guide the modelâ€™s learning process."

    {
      "term": "Overfitting",
      "definition": "When a model learns noise in the training data instead of the actual pattern, leading to poor generalization on new data."

      "term": "Neural Network",
      "definition": "A computational model inspired by the human brain, consisting of layers of interconnected nodes that process information."
